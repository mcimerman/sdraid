- 2 modules dont work when 1 of them is empty but when both sd cards are present it works
- 3 modules dont work even if all 3 sd cards are present
  - but I just need to disconnect MISO from the 3rd one for the 2 to work...

- when VCC is disconnected from the 3rd module, the 2 modules dont work,
  but when I disconnect also GND it works... (with MISO still connected)
